##  Key Features & Analysis

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Cleaned and preprocessed 7,000+ customer records  
- Handled missing values and corrected data types  
- Standardized categorical variables for analysis  

### 2. Churn Identification
- Identified churned vs retained customers  
- Segmented customers based on contracts, tenure, charges, and services  

### 3. Quantitative Churn Analysis (Impact Created)

- **Contract Type**
  - Month-to-month customers account for **~88% of total churn**
  - Customers with one- or two-year contracts show **significantly lower churn (<15%)**

- **Tenure**
  - Customers with tenure less than 12 months contribute to **~55% of churn**
  - Long-term customers (tenure > 36 months) show churn rates below **10%**

- **Monthly Charges**
  - Customers paying higher monthly charges (> ₹70 equivalent) show **~40% higher churn**
  - Lower-paying customers are more stable and less likely to churn

- **Payment Method**
  - Customers using **Electronic Check** contribute to **~45% of total churn**
  - Auto-payment methods show lower churn rates

### 4. Data Visualization
- Visualized churn distribution across all major features  
- Used count plots, bar charts, and histograms  
- Clearly highlighted high-risk customer segments

##  Key Results & Business Impact

- Identified that **1 in every 4 customers churns**
- Found that **contract type and tenure are the strongest churn drivers**
- Highlighted customer segments contributing to **over 80% of churn**
- Provided insights that can help:
  - Target high-risk customers early  
  - Improve contract and pricing strategies  
  - Reduce churn through better payment options
